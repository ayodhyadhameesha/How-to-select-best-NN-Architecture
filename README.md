# How-to-select-best-NN-Architecture
This is a program written in python to find which gives the best R2 score using Grid search CV
 
 
Grid Search CV tool in SK learn library is used to find the best architecture and the best R2 score.
It will give the best activation functions,how many layers and how many neurons each layer should consist to get the best R2 score.
This will make a little bit time but by using this we can get the best architecture by once.
